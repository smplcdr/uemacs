 * Text is kept in buffers. A buffer header, described below, exists for every
 * buffer in the system. The buffers are kept in a big list, so that commands
 * that search for a buffer by name can find the buffer header. There is a
 * safe store for the dot and mark in the header, but this is only valid if
 * the buffer is not being displayed (that is, if "b_nwnd" is 0). The text for
 * the buffer is kept in a circularly linked list of lines, with a pointer to
 * the header line in "b_linep".
 *  Buffers may be "Inactive" which means the files associated with them
 * have not been read in yet. These get read in at "use buffer" time.
